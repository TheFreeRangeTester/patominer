                Hello! I&apos;m <strong>Patricio Miner</strong>, but you can
                call me <strong>Pato</strong>. I&apos;m a QA Engineering
                consultant and trainer based in{" "}
                <strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>. Originally from
                Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·, I made the decision to relocate to New Zealand
                eight years ago (being a Tolkien fan might had something to do
                with this...), embarking on a journey that would transform both
                my personal and professional life. Leaving behind the frenetic
                pace of Buenos Aires, I found solace in an office with a harbour
                view, where I could enjoy lunch while watching stingrays, whales
                and penguins - a truly welcome change.

                With a passion for quality assurance and software testing,
                I&apos;ve dedicated my career to helping organisations{" "}
                <strong>build better, more reliable software</strong>. My
                experience spans across various industries, working with teams
                of all sizes to implement robust testing strategies and
                cultivate a quality-first mindset. In the last years I&apos;ve
                been working in several{" "}
                <strong>high profile AI Projects</strong> for goverment agencies
                and banks, while still building great solutions with code and a
                tester mindset, to keep things scalable, giving meaningful
                feedback and with Quality as number one priority.

              As a trainer, I take great pride in sharing my knowledge and
              experience to the new generations of testers. I&apos;ve done this
              for several years, being the number one place to learn about
              testing and automation in Spanish with{" "}

              . Something I&apos;ve observed working as Test Lead and Manager is
              the lack of career paths and learning resources for people in New
              Zealand. This is when I started to shape the project of sharing my
              knowledge and teaching the ways of Test Engineering to anyone who
              wants to join this beautiful discipline in Software!
